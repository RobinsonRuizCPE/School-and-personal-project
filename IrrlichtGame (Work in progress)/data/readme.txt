The map does not play as a traditional single player adventure. Instead, it
offers a wave-combat type of gameplay. Enemies spawn in waves and each wave
has to be fully defeated to advance to the next wave. The goal of the map is
to set a score as high as possible. When the player has lost all five of his
lives, the game ends and the final high score is determined.
