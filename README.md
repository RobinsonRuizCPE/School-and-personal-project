# School-and-personal-project
This is my personal github for project realised in school or at home. These are far from perfect but you can check the code if you don't know how to implement such project, it's always easier than beginning from nothing :)

# Animation_skinning
Algorithm for skinning a cat. This project dealt with skeleton animation and texture rendering and mapping. Another component of this project was to add an animated cape to the cat using spring physics. The cape is almost done animated and will be implemented after debugging.

# Animation_clothes
The clothes that should be soon added to the cat (end of december 2018). Currently, there are 3 parts on this project :
- GPU programing of spring physics
- Clothes_part 1 is a simple square composed of multiple tensors. It can react to wind and objects like sphere or planes
- Clothes_part 2 is an advanced version of the first part, with more tensors and distortions applied to the clothes. This part isn't operationnal yet but should be finished by the end of december.

# Project Ray_tracing
  Rendering engine coded in c++. Based on ray tracing technologies, this program will create an image from a 3D scene containing      spheres and plane. AA and reflexion are implemented. Future work will be on textures and new primitives.
  
# Parallax 
  Simple program in c++ that implement a "parallax" effect. It can apply a 3D effect on 2D objects and textures by using a height map texture. Height levels can be edited while rendering. We can use this program as base for cell-shading rendering

# IrrlichtGame
Game created from scratch with the irrlicht engine. Work in progress until end of Decembrer 2018. The goal is to make a 3D beat them all with fluid movement and camera (animation and mesh will be updated last). 

# Marching Cube
Implementation of the marching cube algorithm in c++. Use of shaders to create a density function, allowing us to render complex 3D models like double helix or cutom particles effect. Can be improved in many ways, next step is texturing.

Some of the comments in these projects are in written in the beautifull french language, if you have trouble understanding them or if you need more information or if ypou have question about these, feel free to ask me : ruizrobinson@orange.fr
Have fun !
