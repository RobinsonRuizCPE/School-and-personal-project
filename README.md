# Project Ray_tracing
  Rendering engine coded in c++. Based on ray tracing technologies, this program will create an image from a 3D scene containing      spheres and plane. AA and reflexion are implemented. Future work will be on textures and new primitives.
  
# Parallax 
  Simple program in c++ that implement a "parallax" effect. It can apply a 3D effect on 2D objects and textures by using a height map texture. Height levels can be edited while rendering. We can use this program as base for cell-shading rendering

# IrrlichtGame
Game created from scratch with the irrlicht engine. Work in progress until end of Decembrer 2018. The goal is to make a 3D beat them all with fluid movement and camera (animation and mesh will be updated last). 

# Marching Cube
Implementation of the marching cube algorithm in c++. Use of shaders to create a density function, allowing us to render complex 3D models like double helix or cutom particles effect. Can be improved in many ways, next step is texturing.

# tp_skinning
Algorithm for skinning a cat. This project dealt with skeleton animation and texture rendering and mapping. Another component of this project was to add an animated cape to the cat using spring physics. The cape is almost done animated and will be implemented after debugging.
